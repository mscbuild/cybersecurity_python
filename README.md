# 🛡️ Python projects for cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity is a critical field, and Python is a popular programming language for developing tools and projects in this domain.

## Here are some Python project ideas for cybersecurity:

###  1. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

>Code Description:
Packet Capture:
We use scapy.sniff() to capture packets in real time. The packet_callback() function will be called for each packet to analyze it and look for suspicious signs.

>Frequent Request Detection:
We monitor the number of requests from each IP. If one IP makes too many requests in a short time, it may be a sign of a DDoS attack, and the system adds this IP to the suspicious list.

>Suspicious Port Detection:
We check the ports to which packets are sent. If these are ports that are often used for attacks (for example, port 21 - FTP, port 23 - Telnet), the system will notify about suspicious traffic.

>Alert:
When the system detects a suspicious IP or port, it will print a corresponding message to the console.

>Further Improvements:
Snort Rules:
In a real IDS system, more complex Snort rules can be integrated to detect attacks. This will require either using an external library to interpret Snort rules or writing your own parser.

>Log storage:
Add saving of suspicious events to a file or database for further analysis.

>Automatic blocking of attackers:
Implement the ability to block suspicious IPs using built-in firewall mechanisms (for example, using iptables on Linux).

>Processing various types of attacks:
Add additional methods to detect other types of attacks, such as port scanning, ARP spoofing, etc.

>This approach allows you to create a simple but effective system for monitoring and protecting against certain types of attacks.

# 2. Simple Web Application Security Scanner
 

>The basic scanner will check for:

SQL Injection: By injecting simple payloads into parameters.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): By injecting script tags into inputs.

Directory Traversal: Checking if the app is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

Security Headers: Checking for missing HTTP security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security.
